documentation for assessement

For this project i considered many different possible projects i could have studied and used in my website. when doing so i had to condier how i would implement
and how they would be relevent to the website. after this thought process i decided to choose a project that aims at raising awarness of currrent climate problems.
in general i think this was a suitable option as it is relevant to current affairs meaning it would be easy for any type of viewer to understand regardless of age etc.
the website aims at providing basic information about what they can do to reduce their carbon footprint. This part of website is on the 'what can you do' page where
the page is split into three different collumns with the three subtitles 'Recycle''Travel''water consumption'. while doing research on the subject i foubd that these
solutions were the most re-occuring therefore suitable to have as content for the page. the home page is the first page the viewer will see when the index.html file is
run. this page consists of a h1 header with the words "change4Life" in the center of the page. i have also managed to implent a carousel of images related to the website
which change ever 4 seconds. i think this was a useful inclusion as the animated feature as it gets the veiwers attention more than a standard still image. the contact
is a page designed for users to complete a validation form which checks wheather a valid firstname, surname or email has beeen entered and prompts them if not. this is 
followed by a submit button however this button doesnt actually have any functionality to it. the about page is just a page consisting of text which covers the 
background.

When deciding the style of the website i made multiple different hand drawn wire frames. These were based of similar websites to the one i created. by doing this it
gave a good opportunity to see how other different styles would have worked meaning i could see the positive and negative aspects of the different website layouts. 
i think the layout i choose was most appropriate for the website as it reflects the views of it e.g the website aims at reinforcing prevoiusly known information about
therefore having a simple but easy to read website was the best option.

The background image that was chosen for the website is a world map image from creative commons. the image is green with a white background. i thaught this would be a
image given the nature of the website. another feature i took time to decide on was the navigation bar. i felt like this was best way to navigate to the other pages
compared to other methods like a drop down box. i felt that if i had chosen the drop down box it would have got rid of the simplicty of the site and would not fit the 
style of the rest of the website.

One promblem i faced during the project was how the background image would impare the visability of any text on the website. to solve this problem i create a <div> called
box. in doing so it created a square around around the main section of each web page with a reduced occapacity meaning the viewer is able to see the background of the 
side but also able to read the given text. another problem i encountered was on the 'what you can do' page where one column of text would appear on a different line to
the other two columns. i overcame this by using the fle-wrap function in main.css as opposed to placing them manually with pixels position.
