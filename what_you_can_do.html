                    <h2>Recycle</h2>
                      This is the act of proccessing waste product to provide a reusable material. 
                      This can be done in many different ways however the most convinient method of this is recyling
                      food waste. in doing so this reduces the amount of waste that is stored in landfills. moreover 
                      many local councils also provide reward scemes for residents that recyle continously.

                    <h2>Travel</h2>
                        When travelling places we rarely think about the concequences of our actions toward the local 
                        and gloabl environment. in recent years the amount of green travel in the UK has slowly increased. 
                        green travel refers to the use of alternative modes of transport e.g. publike transport or walking.
                        both these methods provide a far more sustainable way of commuting to places compared to more traditional methods.
                        this movemet is already evident in the counties capital and other large cities where low emmision zones have been 
                        intorduced to deter car drivers.

                    <h2>Water Consumption</h2>
                     The consummption of water is one of the most ovelooked by people in developed countries and is often taken for granted.
                     however when we consume wter we often don't even realise the wider impact it hs on the planet. One vitim of this are animals and fish that
                     live and drink from freshwater. due to the depletion of natural freshwater it can provide a lack of natural recources which effect their population. 
                     People living in less developed countries are also effeced negatively as large water consumptions provides an imbalance in these repective counties.
